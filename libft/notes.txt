impossible to compile libft with -Wcast-qual because of ft_strstr and ft_memchr and friends.?

The functions require that we change a (const X *) parameter into an X * return value, which is not really proper C. 

Flags in C:
	* -ftrapv cause: the program to abort on signed integer overflow.
	* -fverbose-asm: is useful if compiling with -S to examine the assembly output. It adds some informative comments.
	* -finstrument-functions: adds code to call user-supplied profiling functions at every function entry and exit point.
