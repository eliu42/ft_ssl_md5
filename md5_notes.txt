Concepts to understand in completing the project:
	1) What is a checksum?
	2) What are the differenes between md5 and previous versions?

make sure to install lldb when we get back

for loops:

	How do I make this in while?

	First 16: auf_f()func.this;
	second 16: auf_g()func.this.
	third 16: auf_h()func.this.
	fourth 16: auf_i()func.this.

Apply checksum to results.
